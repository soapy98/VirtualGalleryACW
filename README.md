# VirtualGalleryACW
The project was completed in the first semester and consisted of two combined modules worth 100% of both.
The aim of the project was to implement a Virtual Gallery within a real-time graphics rendering application. The project was done in DirectX 11 and HLSL. The virutal gallery consisted of models which had various graphical effects alongside other features applied onto them. Some of the features ranged in difficulty inclduing lighting, moddelling and shadow mapping. It required a well designed and robust application such that the various rendering techniques would run smoothly.

There was no framework provided and required a plan and creation of my own framework to satisfy the C++ Programming and Design side of the coursework. It was also done to show evidence of systematic and comprehensive understanding of the C++ language with object-oriented principles through a specific standardization of Parasoft rules and disciplines.
